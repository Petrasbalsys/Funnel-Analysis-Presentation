## The Task  

**The mission**: turn messy event data into a useful funnel chart!

Here’s what we’ll be doing:

**Clean up the data** – Write a query to remove duplicates so our funnel analysis isn’t a total mess.

**Find the top 3 countries** – Figure out which countries have the most events and compare how they move through the funnel.

**Spot cool insights** – Think outside the box! Are there any other interesting slices of data worth looking at?

**Build the funnel chart(s)** – Use the cleaned-up data to visualize the journey.

**Take notes on key findings** – Anything surprising? Anything broken? Jot it down.

**Share your work** – Be ready to give a quick (5-10 min) walkthrough of your funnel sheet to your fellow analysts.

Let’s turn this raw data into something awesome!
